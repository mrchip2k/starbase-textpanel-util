# starbase-textpanel-util
A utility website for the game Starbase, to find and copy visually interesting characters in Text Panels.

I made this website mostly as an exercise in web development, while also making a useful tool for the community.

## About Telegrama, the font
The font is originally from [here](http://yoworks.com/telegrama/index.html). 

Starbase uses the Telegrama font, with many special characters removed from it.

This website uses it to show what the special characters will look like in game.

The Telegrama font file is included in this repository, since I found no other way to get it working online. If you are the font's owner and have an issue with this, please contact me: mrchip2k@gmail.com

In any case, this repository's license does not extend to the Telegrama font.
